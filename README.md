# pokemonData

**UPDATE:** As of November 21, 2020, the data files have been updated to include Pokémon through Generation #898, Calyrex (including its Rider forms). Also included are stat updates to 26 Pokémon that were made as of Generation 7, courtesy of [ItsASine](https://github.com/ItsASine). We also cleaned the ASCII character mangling for male & female forms of Nidoran by replacing them with the words Male and Female, as is the standard in newer generations of Pokémon. 

As of July 4, 2018, the data files have been updated to include all seven generations of Pokémon through #807, [Zeraora](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/zeraora). 

Repository containing generations 1 - 6 of basic Pokémon stats, split out from a Kaggle.com dataset originally created by Alberto Barradas, [Pokémon with stats](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)
