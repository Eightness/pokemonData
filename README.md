## December 2021 Update

As of December 14, 2021, no Pokémon have been added to the Pokédex beyond #898, Calyrex. If the January 28, 2022 release of *Pokémon Legends Arceus* contains additions to the National Pokédex, we'll update this repository to include the new Pokémon. 

## November 2021 Update

As of November 21, 2020, the data files have been updated to include Pokémon through Generation #898, Calyrex (including its Rider forms). Also included are stat updates to 26 Pokémon that were made as of Generation 7, courtesy of [ItsASine](https://github.com/ItsASine). We also cleaned the ASCII character mangling for male & female forms of Nidoran by replacing them with the words Male and Female, as is the standard in newer generations of Pokémon. 

Finally, we split the Form / Forme / Region / Gender modifiers from Pokémon names, saving them to a column named Form. 

As of July 4, 2018, the data files have been updated to include all seven generations of Pokémon through #807, [Zeraora](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/zeraora). 

Repository containing generations 1 - 6 of basic Pokémon stats, split out from a Kaggle.com dataset originally created by Alberto Barradas, [Pokémon with stats](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)
